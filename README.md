# Snake

<img src="img/snek.PNG" width=300px height=300px/>

Classic snake game in C using modern OpenGL (with Direct State Access).  
OpenGL 4.6 recommended. Although it should work with 4.5 as well with some tweaks in the code.  
Tested on Windows. For using in Linux, you'll have to make some more changes.  

`WASD` or arrow keys to start the game and move the snake  
`R` to restart in case of a gameover  
`Q` or `ESC` to quit
